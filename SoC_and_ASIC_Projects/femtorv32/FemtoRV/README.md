References to other RISC-V cores
--------------------------------

- The reference: Claire Wolf's [picorv32](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32) (borrowed many ideas from there).
- The smallest RISC-V: [SERV](https://github.com/olofk/serv), you can fit 5 instances (!) in 1000 LUTs.
- Faster cores, Linux capable cores: [biriscv](https://github.com/ultraembedded/biriscv/), [VexRiscv](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv)
- FemtoRV32's best friend: [ICE-V](https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice/tree/master/projects/ice-v),
     written in [Silice](https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice/) (a higher-level HDL)
