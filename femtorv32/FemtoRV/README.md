FEMTORV32 / FEMTOSOC: a minimalistic RISC-V CPU 
===============================================

Features
--------

- Implements the RV32I or RV32IM instruction set (minus FENCE and SYSTEM).
- Synthesis using the freeware tools (Yosys and nextpnr).    
- Main goal: to be used for teaching, easy to read, fitting on the ICEstick, 
      fun demos (graphics), equip students for approx. $40.
- Disclaimer: I'm no FPGA expert, please feel free to comment, to
      give me some advice !
- Runs at 80MHz on the ICEStick and on the ULX3S.
- 6kb RAM (ICEStick) or 256kb (ULX3S)
- Firmware can be generated with gnu RISC-V toolsuite (script included), in C or in assembly.
- SOC memory-mapped device drivers and hardware for UART, built-in LEDs, OLed display, led matrix.
- femtolibC, femtoGL (everything fits in 6kb).
- includes @ultraembedded's fat_io_lib (access to FAT filesystem on SDCards).
- "femtOS" virtual output support: redirects printf() to UART, OLED screen (or led matrix, WIP).
- many RISC-V assembly and C demo programs, including graphics for the OLED display.

First column is a standard configuration for IceStick (UART and LED configured, 6Kb RAM, two-level shifter). This
corresponds to the second line of the Dhrystones test. Second column measures the impact of the two-level shifter
(eats up 40 LUTs). Third column is a minimalistic configuration, with no peripheral (just LEDs) and minimal RAM,
to have an idea of how many LUTs the processor alone uses (less than 1000, achievement unlocked !).

FemtoRV32 makes a compromise between complexity (the sources fit in 1000 lines of Verilog and - I think - are easy to read),
LUT count (1000 is also the magic number here) and performance (around 1000 Dhrystones/s/MHz, most instructions take between
2 and 3 cycles).
